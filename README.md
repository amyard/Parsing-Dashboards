You can clone or download this repo:
https://github.com/amyard/Parsing-Dashboards.git

Then cd into the repo:
cd Parsing-Dashboards

Now create and activate a virtualenv (noting the python runtime):
On a mac:
virtualenv -p <python version> venv
source venv/bin/activate

On a Windows:
virtualenv -p <python version> venv
venv/Scripts/activate

Now that virtualenv is setup and active we can install the dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Once the dependencies have been installed, cd into the project.
For Project 1 and some files from Project 2 use jupyter notebook.

For Project 2 -> file "full_dash.py" / "maps_interactive.py" type in console:

python <mane of file>.py
